# Overview

This project aims to simplify the preparation of accurate electromagnetic head models for EEG forward modeling.

It builds off of the seminal [SimNIBS](http://simnibs.org/) tool the field modelling of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation. Human skin, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain meshing pipelines have been rewritten with Nipype to ease access parallel processing and to allow users to start/stop the workflows. Conductivity tensor mapping from diffusion-weighted imaging is also included.

At present these pipelines depend on interfaces for [Gmsh](http://geuz.org/gmsh/) and [Meshfix](https://code.google.com/p/meshfix/) that can only be found in the enh/conductivity branch of my fork of [Nipype](https://github.com/swederik/nipype). 

A paper describing the tool has been accepted for publication in NeuroImage:
