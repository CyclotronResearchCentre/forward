{"name":"Forward","tagline":"Realistic forward modeling from structural MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging","body":"# Overview\r\n\r\nThis project aims to simplify the preparation of accurate electromagnetic head models for EEG forward modeling.\r\n\r\nIt builds off of the seminal [SimNIBS](http://simnibs.org/) tool the field modelling of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation. Human skin, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain meshing pipelines have been rewritten with Nipype to ease access parallel processing and to allow users to start/stop the workflows. Conductivity tensor mapping from diffusion-weighted imaging is also included.\r\n\r\nAt present these pipelines depend on interfaces for [Gmsh](http://geuz.org/gmsh/) and [Meshfix](https://code.google.com/p/meshfix/) that can only be found in the enh/conductivity branch of my fork of [Nipype](https://github.com/swederik/nipype). \r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\nTo install the package, run:\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\nSet environment variable FWD_DIR to the root path of the installation directory by placing\r\n\r\n    export FWD_DIR=/path/to/forward\r\n\r\nin your .bashrc or .zshrc file.\r\n# References\r\nThe citations for these tools are:\r\n\r\n**SimNIBS: Simulation of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation**\r\n\r\nWindhoff, M., Opitz, A. and Thielscher, A.
