# 1 dipole(s)
# Explanation with regard to the magnitude matrix:
# Each column of the magnitude matrix below results in one forward simulated
# sample. Each row corresponds to the respective dipole. If, like in this source file,
# each column has only one nonzero 1 entry, then only the corresponding single dipole contributes
# to the forward simulated field sample. Two nonzero 1 entries in a single column would result
# in a field sample produced by the two corresponding simultaneously active dipoles etc..
